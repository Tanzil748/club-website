        <h2>FILIPINO AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH</h2>
        <p>
          We are so happy to be celebrating this amazing month with everyone!
          FAHM is vital for our club to observe as one of the main goals of the
          club is to celebrate and learn about Filipino culture, including our
          history, from the perspective of a Fil-Am organization. Therefore, we
          will be dedicating this whole month to really sharing with you all
          some knowledge and history that you may or may not already know! ‚ù§
          <br />
          This will be our first GBM in-person!!!üéâ So, we are so excited to see
          you all there and have it serve as a preface to what the rest of the
          month will look like for TROPA.
          <br />
          We are very proud to be celebrating this month with you all and we
          hope that you all take in some important lessons about Filipino
          American history throughout this month. We hope you learn something
          new and exciting‚ù£
